# ForkTest
This program creates two processes. First process(child) creates a text file(if it doesn't exists) named "forkFile1" and writes a message in it. The second process creates another file(again, if it doesn't exists) named "forkFile2" and copies all the content from the 1st file in the 2nd, after that he adds another message in the 2nd file and displays it's content.
